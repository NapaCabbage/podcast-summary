============================================================

the US-China cold war takes a big step up

A big day of small news:SWE-Bench Verified is dead, andSaaS/DoorDash stocks notably droppedwith a lot of back and forth today onthe Citrini 2028 essay, but we will dismiss doomer scifi as we didAI 2027, not because it may not come true, but because it is unverifiable.

What is reasonably believable today is Anthropic’s-VERY- widely viewedand criticized accusations of 3 of the leading Chinese labs of distillation:

The sizes of the distillation vary a lot - Minimax is an order of magnitude larger than Moonshot which is an order of magnitude higher than DeepSeek:

However, the timing also matters - Anthropic also says they caught MiniMax during an active distillation run, presumably for M2.5, but it is also easier to catch during an active run as compared to DeepSeek which presumably both did less and also mostly done during the V3 and R1 run. (Or… they are better at hiding it?)

It’s worth mentioning that Qwen and Z.ai (GLM) were not accused. None of the companies implicated have yet responded.

Anthropic is not alone in this - OpenAI has made similar though less public complaints both last year and recently.

The story is interestingly timed amid Dario’s calls for stricter export controls on China, ahead of the DeepSeek V4 release, and comments on Chinese open source models “catching up” to Western closed models.


## AI Twitter Recap


Anthropic’s Claude “distillation attacks” allegation (and the industry blowback)

Anthropic’s claim: Anthropic says it detectedindustrial-scaleClaude distillation byDeepSeek,Moonshot AI, andMiniMax:~24,000 fraudulent accountsgenerating>16M Claude exchanges, allegedly to extract capabilities for their own models (Anthropic,follow-up,blog link tweet). Anthropic frames the risk as both competitive (capabilities transfer) and safety/geopolitical (safeguards removal, downstream military/intel use).

Community reaction / “hypocrisy” thread: A large fraction of replies frame this as “labs trained on the internet now complaining about copying,” often explicitly contrasting scraping vs API-output extraction (Elon,ThePrimeagen,Teknium,Suhail,HKydlicek). Others argue distillation at this scale is meaningfully different because it can replicatetool use / agent behaviorsand potentially bypass safety controls (RundownAI summary,LiorOnAI take).

Second-order implications: The thread crystallizes a security model shift: frontier models are increasingly protected not just by weights secrecy and compute scarcity, but byAPI abuse resistance(account fraud detection, rate-limit evasion, behavioral fingerprinting, watermarking, etc.). It also reopens the question of whetherexport controlscan matter if capabilities can be “copied” via outputs at scale (LiorOnAI).

Coding agents: real adoption, real failures, and the “agentic engineering” playbook

Codex + Claude Code momentum (and memes masking real workflow change): A lot of the highest-engagement posts are “agents are here” anecdotes—weekend building with Codex (OpenAIDevs,gdb)—and cautionary tales about giving agents too much authority. The canonical failure mode in this set is instruction loss / compaction leading to unintended destructive actions (email deletion) in OpenClaw-style setups (summeryue0,follow-up root-cause, plus others reacting to “write access” risk:Yuchenj_UW).

Inference & systems: WebSockets for agents, ultra-fast on-chip inference, and infra scaling narratives

OpenAI Responses API adds WebSocketsfor low-latency, long-running, tool-heavy agents. Rationale: persistent connection + in-memory state means you send incremental inputs instead of full context; claimed20–40% speedupsfor 20+ tool calls (OpenAIDevs, detail:OpenAIDevs, adoption:OpenAIDevs). Cline reports early measurements: ~15% faster simple tasks, ~39% faster complex workflows, best cases 50% faster (cline). Steven Heidel attributes Codex speedups to WebSockets (stevenheidel).

## 1. Anthropic Distillation Attacks


Anthropic: “We’ve identified industrial-scale distillation attacks on our models by DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax.” 🚨(Activity: 4207):Anthropic has identified that DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax have conducted industrial-scale distillation attacks on their models. These attacks involved creating over24,000fraudulent accounts and executing over16 millionexchanges with Anthropic’s model, Claude, to extract its capabilities for their own model improvements. This highlights a significant security and intellectual property challenge in the AI industry, where model capabilities can be illicitly extracted and replicated.Commenters are drawing parallels between these distillation attacks and the broader AI industry’s practices of using data without explicit rights, suggesting a double standard in Anthropic’s complaint. There’s also skepticism about how Anthropic built its own dataset, hinting at potential ethical concerns.The discussion highlights a potential irony in Anthropic’s complaint about distillation attacks, as their own model training likely involved using large datasets without explicit permissions. This raises questions about the ethical implications of data usage in AI development, especially when companies like Anthropic have built their models on data they did not own or have rights to use.The mention of industrial-scale distillation attacks by companies like DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax suggests a competitive landscape where AI models are being reverse-engineered or replicated. This could involve using API access to extract model outputs and train similar models, which poses significant challenges for intellectual property protection in AI.There is a suggestion that Anthropic’s dataset might have been manually annotated by humans, which implies a significant investment in data quality and curation. This contrasts with the idea of distillation attacks, where competitors might bypass such efforts by leveraging existing models’ outputs to train their own systems.

Distillation when you do it. Training when we do it.(Activity: 1098):The image is a meme that humorously highlights the perceived hypocrisy in the AI community regarding model distillation. It contrasts the negative perception of distillation when done by others versus the positive framing of it as ‘training data’ when done by oneself. This reflects ongoing debates about the ethics and ownership of AI models, particularly in the context of using large models to create smaller, more efficient ones through distillation. The comments discuss the implications of this practice, noting that smaller models often derive their capabilities from larger, distilled models, and question the defensibility of proprietary models when distillation is prevalent.Commenters highlight the irony and potential hypocrisy in the AI industry’s stance on distillation, with some pointing out that many smaller models owe their performance to distillation from larger models. There’s also a discussion on the challenges of protecting proprietary models from being distilled by competitors.IkeaDefender highlights the technical strategy of using distillation to create low-cost models from larger ones, suggesting that the ‘secret sauce’ of these models is their derivation from more complex, frontier models. This raises questions about the defensibility of investments in frontier models, as companies have not demonstrated effective methods to prevent others from scraping and distilling their models.MasterLJ draws a parallel between the practices of tech giants like Google and Amazon and the current AI landscape. They argue that just as Google indexed the internet and controlled access through robots.txt, AI companies are now controlling model access and distillation. This control is likened to Amazon’s strategic shift on sales tax, where they initially opposed state-by-state taxes until it became advantageous for them, illustrating a pattern of leveraging control for competitive advantage.Samy_Horny discusses the reluctance of companies to open-source their models, using the example of MCP being made open-source only after its popularity was evident. They express skepticism about the likelihood of models like Gemma or GPT-OSS being open-sourced, as it would mean revealing too much proprietary information or ‘secret sauce.’

## 2. Qwen Model and Data Quality Issues


Qwen3’s most underrated feature: Voice embeddings(Activity: 686):The post discusses the voice embedding feature of Qwen3 TTS, which converts a voice into a high-dimensional vector (1024or2048dimensions) for voice cloning and manipulation. This allows for mathematical operations on voices, such as gender and pitch transformation, voice averaging, and creating an emotion space. The voice embedding model is a small encoder with a few million parameters, and the author has made it available for standalone use, including optimized ONNX models for web inference. The image illustrates a 2D t-SNE projection of this embedding space, showing how different voice characteristics can be combined and manipulated. The author also provides a link to their collection onHugging Faceand a GitHub repository for inference using theirvllm-omnifork.One commenter is curious about the ability to transform voice embeddings and generate speech from them, indicating interest in practical applications like gender or robotic transformations. Another sees potential in using this for speaker identification, questioning how parameters related to gender or emotion were determined.MixtureOfAmateurs inquires about the potential for transforming voice embeddings to modify characteristics such as gender or robotic tone, and then using these modified embeddings for speech generation. This suggests a use case beyond simple encoding, potentially involving complex transformations and synthesis processes.HopePupal raises the possibility of using voice embeddings for speaker identification, questioning how parameters related to gender or emotion are determined. This implies a need for understanding the feature space of embeddings and how specific attributes are encoded within them.StoneCypher outlines a desire for advanced voice cloning capabilities, including the use of IPA for pronunciation, emotional cue integration with easing and stacking, and precise word timing control. This highlights the demand for sophisticated control over synthesized speech, which could be facilitated by detailed voice embeddings.
